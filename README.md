# OOP_CorseWork
My first course work. It's main purpose is implementing OOP paradigm in the basic program.

This program executes basic maths operation, such as +,-,*,%. 
The program uses signal->handler architecture, which means each object has its separated functionality, and after it has made it's work, it sends data to the next handler.
The input must be like: 15 - 5 * 9 % 15 - 404 + 505
The output will be: 	
15 - 5 = 10 
10 * 9 = 90 
90 % 15 = 0
0 - 404 = -404 
-404 + 505 = 101

Program consists of 9 files, the working IDE was Microsoft Visual Studio.
